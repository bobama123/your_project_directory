#1) Desribe the Problem:

# As a user
# So that I can manage my time
# I want to see an estimate of reading time for a text, assuming that
# i can read 200 words a minute.


#2) Design the Function Signature:

def reading_time(text):
    # Parameters:
    #   text: a string containing words e.g. "Hello World"
    # Return:
    #   time (in seconds), which represents how long the text will take
    #       to read at 200 words a minute (60 seconds)
    #       E.g. 0.6 seconds
    pass

#3) Create Examples as Tests:

# 1 - If we give it an empty string
#     It will return 0 seconds.

reading_time("")
# = 0 seconds

# 2 - If we give it a text with 2 words
#     It will return 0.6 seconds.

reading_time("Hello World")
# = 0.6 seconds

# 3 - If we give it a text with 5 words and a comma.
#     It will return 1.5 seconds.

reading_time("Hello World, I am here")
# = 1.5 seconds
